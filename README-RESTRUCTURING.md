# Atomic Momentum Restructuring

## Overview

This document outlines the restructuring process for the Atomic Momentum habit tracking application. The goal was to transform the monolithic server.py file into a properly organized project structure with separation of concerns.

## Project Structure

The restructured project now follows this organization:

```
atomic-momentum/
├── assets/          # Static assets like images
├── components/      # Future home for modular JS components
├── scripts/         # JavaScript files 
│   └── main.js      # Main application logic
├── styles/          # CSS stylesheets
│   └── main.css     # Main application styles
├── templates/       # HTML templates
│   ├── index.html   # Main application HTML
│   └── notifications-test.html # Notifications testing page
├── server.py        # Python HTTP server (now simplified)
└── .cursorrules     # Cursor AI configuration file
```

## Phase 1 Restructuring

The initial restructuring focused on these key areas:

1. **CSS Extraction**: 
   - Moved all style code into separate `/styles/main.css` 
   - Removed embedded `<style>` blocks from HTML templates
   - Updated HTML templates to reference external stylesheets

2. **JavaScript Extraction**:
   - Moved all JavaScript code into `/scripts/main.js`
   - Removed embedded `<script>` blocks from HTML templates
   - Updated templates to reference external script files

3. **HTML Templating**:
   - Created dedicated templates directory
   - Moved HTML code into separate template files
   - Ensured server correctly serves templates

4. **Server Simplification**:
   - Simplified server.py to focus on routing
   - Added static file handling for CSS, JS, and assets
   - Maintained existing functionality during transition

## Future Development

This restructuring sets the stage for future improvements:

1. **Component Modularization**: Further break down `main.js` into smaller component files
2. **Additional Optimizations**: Implement code splitting, lazy loading, etc.
3. **Backend Improvements**: Migrate to a more robust backend framework
4. **Database Integration**: Move from localStorage to server-side storage

## How to Run

To run the restructured application:

```bash
python server.py
```

Then visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

## Implementation Notes

- All functionality from the original application has been preserved
- Code organization now follows best practices for web development
- Future changes should maintain this separated structure
- The `.cursorrules` file provides guidance for AI-assisted development
