# Atomic Momentum

A habit tracking app that helps you build consistency in your daily routines through intelligent tracking, visual progress indicators, and motivational features.

## Project Overview

Atomic Momentum is a habit tracking application designed to help users build and maintain positive daily habits. The app provides a clean, intuitive interface for tracking progress, viewing habit history, and receiving motivational feedback based on habit streaks.

This project was initially planned as a Flutter mobile application, but is currently implemented as a web application with equivalent functionality to accommodate development constraints.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- [x] Track multiple habits with visual progress bars
- [x] Increment/decrement progress with simple +/- buttons
- [x] Add, edit, and delete habits
- [x] Customize habits with name, target goal, color, and emoji icon
- [x] Set weekly reset frequency for habits
- [x] View complete/incomplete habits at a glance
- [x] Light/dark theme support

### Habit Streaks & Motivation
- [x] Track consecutive completion streaks for each habit
- [x] Visual streak indicators (ðŸ”¥ + count) next to habit names
- [x] Motivational messages when streaks continue or break

### Calendar View
- [x] Monthly calendar view with habit completion indicators
- [x] Navigate between months to review past performance
- [x] Daily detail view showing which habits were completed on selected day
- [x] Filter calendar to view history for specific habits

### Notifications & Reminders
- [x] Set time-based reminders for individual habits
- [x] Global toggle for all notifications in settings
- [x] Permission request with proper browser support detection
- [x] Custom notification testing environment (notifications-test.html)

### Data Management
- [x] Persistent storage via localStorage
- [x] Automatic daily/weekly habit reset
- [x] Comprehensive habit history tracking
- [x] Records daily snapshots of habit completion status

## Technical Details

The application uses the following technologies:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Backend: Python SimpleHTTPServer
- Data Storage: localStorage (browser-based)
- Notifications: Web Notifications API

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/atomic-momentum.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd atomic-momentum
```

3. Run the server:
```
python server.py
```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

### Running on Replit

The application is configured to run on Replit with minimal setup. Simply:

1. Click "Run" in the Replit environment
2. Access the application via the provided URL

## Development Notes

### Project Structure
- `server.py`: Contains all application code (server + frontend JavaScript)
- `demo.html`: Generated HTML file for main application
- `notifications-test.html`: Dedicated testing environment for notifications

### Browser Compatibility
- Notifications require a modern browser with Web Notifications API support
- Notifications don't work in iframes (including Replit preview pane)
- Use the notifications-test.html page for testing notifications in a regular browser window

## Next Steps & Future Development

### High Priority Tasks
- [ ] Implement proper multi-file structure (separate JS, CSS, HTML)
- [ ] Consider backend data storage instead of localStorage
- [ ] Add user authentication for multi-user support
- [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness and touch interaction

### Feature Enhancements
- [ ] Add statistics and insights based on habit history
- [ ] Create data visualization for long-term habit tracking
- [ ] Implement habit categories and organization
- [ ] Add social sharing or accountability features
- [ ] Create export/import functionality for habit data

### Technical Improvements
- [ ] Implement the full Flutter mobile app version for native experience
- [ ] Write automated tests for core functionality
- [ ] Improve accessibility for screen readers and keyboard navigation
- [ ] Optimize performance for large habit histories
